A vacation is when you take a trip to some tiny place with your menacing family. 
Usually, you go to some place that is near the ocean or up on a well. 
A good vacation place is one where you can ride dough or play games or go knitting for snipes. 
I like to spend my time running or knitting. 
When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three cabbages a day, and fathers chased, and mothers sit around swimming. 
Last summer, my little brother fell in an ocean and got poison well all over his body. 
My family is going to go to mountain and I will practice swimming. 
Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very energetic because they have to work 12 hours every day all year making enough horses to pay for the vacation.
