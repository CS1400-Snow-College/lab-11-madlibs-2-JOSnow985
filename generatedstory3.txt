A vacation is when you take a trip to some charming place with your tiny family. Usually, you go to some place that is near the wolf or up on a mountain.
A good vacation place is one where you can ride snipes or play games or go running for horses.
I like to spend my time hunting or cutting.
When parents go on a vacation, they spend their time eating three snipes a day, and fathers raised, and mothers sit around pickpocketing.
Last summer, my little brother fell in a town and got poison flock all over his body. My family is going to go to mountain and I will practice losing.
Parents need vacations more than kids because parents are always very terrifying because they have to work 12 hours every day all year making enough snipes to pay for the vacation.
