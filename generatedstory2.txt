A incredible village of animals had a problem with eat fisherpeople. Those that golfed the tragedies described small eyes in the fog, that chased them through the shiny fog.
After another ship was destroyed, the fisherpeople had had enough, and set out to hunting for whatever those eyes belonged to.
When the remote hunters saw the charming eyes pickpocketing through the fog with their intimidating piercing light, they didn't turn back.
As they glowed toward the lights, their incredible size diminished, until they saw the culprit on a amplified island shore.
A terrifying, hungry wolf survived along the shore. His eyes golfed in the night, their brightness unnaturally charming by the many incredible ships on the beach.
