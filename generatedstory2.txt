A hungry village of ships had a problem with knitting fisherpeople.
Those that yelled the tragedies described piercing eyes in the fog, that sidled them through the thick fog.
After another ship was destroyed, the villagers had had enough, and set out to eat for whatever those eyes belonged to.
When the brave hunters saw the cute eyes losing through the fog with their energetic hungry light, they didn't turn back.
As they yelled toward the lights, their remote size diminished, until they saw the culprit on a tiny island shore.
A small, menacing wolf yelled along the shore. His eyes sailed in the night, their brightness unnaturally stressed by the many menacing animals on the beach.
