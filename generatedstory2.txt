A thick village of animals had a problem with knitting rocks. 
Those that jeered the tragedies described menacing eyes in the fog, that sailed them through the terrifying fog. 
After another ship was destroyed, the fisherpeople had had enough, and set out to search for whatever those eyes belonged to. 
When the brave hunters saw the incredible eyes losing through the fog with their shiny tiny light, they didn't turn back. 
As they survived toward the lights, their shiny size diminished, until they saw the culprit on a thick island shore. 
A hungry, brave ivy golfed along the shore. 
His eyes sailed in the night, their brightness unnaturally piercing by the many intimidating animals on the beach.
