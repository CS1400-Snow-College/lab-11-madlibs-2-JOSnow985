An intimidating village of rocks had a problem with cutting ships. 
Those that waved the tragedies described brave eyes in the fog, that golfed them through the cute fog. 
After another ship was destroyed, the villagers had had enough, and set out to eat for whatever those eyes belonged to. 
When the intimidating hunters saw the cute eyes knitting through the fog with their incredible small light, they didn't turn back. 
As they glowed toward the lights, their tiny size diminished, until they saw the culprit on an intimidating island shore. 
A tiny, energetic crab laughed along the shore. 
His eyes jeered in the night, their brightness unnaturally intimidating by the many tiny rocks on the beach.
