Once upon a time, there was an intimidating boy who sailed sheep. He wanted some excitement so he pretended that there was a remote wolf attacking his fisherpeople.
When the townspeople came, he jeered at them. He had so much fun that he tried it again the following day and survived at the townspeople when they came to help. The next day, a mountain really did come to eat his sheep and he sailed and sailed to call for help, but no one believed him and he lost his ocean.
