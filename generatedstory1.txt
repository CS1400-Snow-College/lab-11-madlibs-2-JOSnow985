Once upon a time, there was an energetic boy who sailed sheep. 
He wanted some excitement so he pretended that there was a cute mountain attacking his rocks. 
When the townspeople came, he yelled at them. 
He had so much fun that he tried it again the following day and waved at the townspeople when they came to help. 
The next day, an ivy really did come to eat his sheep and he jeered and golfed to call for help, but no one believed him and he lost his wolf.
