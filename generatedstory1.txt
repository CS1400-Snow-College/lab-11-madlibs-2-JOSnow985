Once upon a time, there was a charming boy who chased sheep. 
He wanted some excitement so he pretended that there was an amplified wolf attacking his rocks. 
When the townspeople came, he raised at them. 
He had so much fun that he tried it again the following day and raised at the townspeople when they came to help. 
The next day, an ocean really did come to eat his sheep and he sailed and sailed to call for help, but no one believed him and he lost his flock.
