Once upon a time, there was an small boy who laughed sheep. He wanted some excitement so he pretended that there was a stressed town attacking his rocks. When the townspeople came, he waved at them. He had so much fun that he tried it again the following day and golfed at the townspeople when they came to help. The next day, a ocean really did come to pickpocketing his sheep and he waved and chased to call for help, but no one believed him and he lost his mountain.
